# E-library app
In this project, I built a cross-platform mobile application using Flutter that allows users to manage their book library. The app includes features to add, edit, delete, and view books. Users can also rate books and mark them as read or unread. The app will store user preferences such as the sorting order of the book list using Shared Preferences.
